# Stopgo

StopGo v2.0 is a stop-motion animation application.
Its goal is to be a simple and direct way to take a series of photographs, with onion-skinning, to create stop-motion animation.

StopGo is free and open source.

## Download and Install

Git is where we do development. If you want to download and use StopGo to make movies, get it here:

You are free to use it at home, in the classroom, or anywhere!
You are free to share it with others.

## System Requirements

To use StopGo, you must install [Java (OpenJDK) 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

## Development 

This version of Stopgo has been re-written in Java (v1.0 was written in Python).
If you are a Java coder, or you're learning Java, then you can help us improve StopGo.

To contribute code:

* Download and install [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/). It's also free and open source and works on all platforms.
* Download and install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) so NetBeans can manage dependencies.
* Download the Stopgo source code by cloning this Git repository.

Read through the project code carefully to understand how StopGo works.
Once you understand which class does what, and what each method provides, start making whatever improvements you feel are needed.

When you've finished, submit a patch or merge request through Git or by email.
